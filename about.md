I've been separately writing music, and code, for almost the last 20 years.

Late 2011 I realized my dream of combining my two hobbies into one and Burns Modular is the result.  Beginning with DJPad for WebOS, then Android, and most recently the BlackBerry PlayBook, DJPad is my first commercial product.  In late summer 2012 I released my second audio application, OSCPad, which will bring custom OSC layouts to Android devices and in the future, the Blackberry Playbook as well.

Future plans for Burns Modular involve more music apps as well as unique hardware synthesizers and modular synth modules.  As this is a completely self-bootstrapped effort I plan on focusing on software until revenue is great enough to risk a hardware product.

Any questions?  I'm always available.  Email me: tom@burnsmod.com
