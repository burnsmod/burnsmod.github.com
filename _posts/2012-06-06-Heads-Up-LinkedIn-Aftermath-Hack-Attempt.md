Heads up!

Anyone else getting emails like this?

I do have a LinkedIn account and the password would likely have been hacked by now based on it's complexity (eep).

Looks like whoever has access to the usernames list is already starting to crossreference the entries and start cracking other site accounts.

It's possible this was unrelated to LinkedIn but seems rather unlikely based on timing.  Either the people who hacked LinkedIn don't sleep or maybe the (username, password) list is now in the hands of a wider group.
