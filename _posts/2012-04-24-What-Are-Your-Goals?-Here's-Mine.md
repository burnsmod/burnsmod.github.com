description: To grow my business, here are the goals I set for May 2012.

{% include JB/setup %}

As a self-motivated, self-directed developer and business person I cannot understate the importance of setting goals.


##Why

Burns Modular is my part-time side business.  I've released an app ([DJPad, a DJ app for Android and Playbook](http://www.burnsmod.com)) and made hundreds of sales, but besides coming feature improvements and upgrades, I have no further responsibilities to meet.  My growth is entirely self-driven and as such I need to choose a horizon I want to travel to and point my efforts into making it to that destination.

By setting long- and short-term goals I gain:
- a guide to direct my efforts to grow my business as opposed to a less growth-oriented approach.
- the extra push to complete tasks I may otherwise put off.
- a metric I can use to compare my expectations with reality.  If the goals I chose as "obtainable" are actually "unobtainable", this implies a disconnect between how I think my business is doing, and reality.

Lets focus on that last point for a moment longer.  Disconnection from reality is a leading cause of failure, whether it's in an inter-personal relationship ("she loves me"), business plan ("Monetization?  But we're the next twitter"), or hobbyist development ("Practice?  But I'm a rock *gawd*").  If you fail at your goals, analyze the reasons why to better re-align yourself with reality.


##How

Do not hastily choose goals.  They should be stepping stones towards your overall destination.  For this reason it may be more useful to decide on long-term goals first, and then orient your short-term goals as stepping stones.

The goals one sets should be obtainable, realistic, and dependent on few outside influences.  They should also present a challenge that will require a push in order to overcome.


##Short Term

I will not bore you with the day-to-day minutia of app and website development.  My short-term goals are month-long, making them due at the end of May, 2012.  With these goals in mind, my day-to-day work becomes relatively obvious.


###Goal 1: I will get 100,000 visits to this website.

(First of all I'd like to thank you for contributing slightly to this goal ;) )

Right now if you google "android dj app", DJPad is probably not on the front page (it is for me but that's because I've shared it on Google+).  Google Analytics combined with Google Webmaster Tools is a great source of information on how I'm doing on the SEO front:

So how am I doing?  Survey says: Not. Very. Good.

Similarily I am not in the top results for dj app if you search the Google Play market.  I'm doing a lot better on BlackBerry Playbook as I'm the only DJ application on the device currently.

I plan on reaching 100k visitors this month with a series of blog posts on a variety of topics.  I've been on HackerNews and Hack-A-Day previously leading to an average of 20,000 hits per post, which makes me think that with a concentrated effort I should be able to obtain 100,000 hits in the month of May.

Hopefully the increase in traffic will result in:
- more social interaction (FB, twitter).
- re-posting on sites without 'rel="nofollow"', increasing my PageRank.
- increase in DJPad sales & downloads.

Aside from blog posts I'd like to add more youtube videos of DJPad.  Right now [the only video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6p1emSaRV4) is from the TouchPad version and it's rather out of date / blurry.

###Goal 2: I will release my second app.

In an attempt to diversify I have a small app written that is not a music app.  It's a native port of a small web-app I wrote in the past.  I don't really want to spoil the surprise, so details are kept secret for now.  The one thing I can say is that it uses the same framework as DJPad which allows the same codebase (written overtop SDL) to be released on Android, Playbook, iOS, and HP TouchPad.  

This app has no competition I have been able to see, which may either imply there's money to be made - or there's no market at all.  The app is mostly finished but needs polish and testing before it can be released, which I believe is within my grasp to complete by the end of May.

##Long Term Goal

So, why am I pushing myself instead of just enjoying my time?  My long term goal is:

### I will no longer work in a cubicle by the time I'm 30.

I just turned 28 now.  I need sustained 10x revenue before I'm entering the profit range that would allow me to quit my day job.  

By bootstrapping, by the time I've grown the business this far I should also have paid off enough of my house debt to be at less risk to leave my full-time job.

I no longer want to work for anyone.  This is my escape, if I can capture it.
